1. E-commerce Sales Analysis
   
Conducted an SQL-based analysis of sales and customer behavior patterns for a Korean e-commerce website.

3. Amazon Sales Data (EDA) 
   
Exploring sales trends and customer segmentation in Amazon's dataset. This SQL analysis project leverages advanced SQL techniques to extract actionable insights from an Amazon product dataset.

I used Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Window Functions to perform tasks such as ranking the top-performing products by category, analyzing pricing and discount trends, and segmenting customers based on their review activity. The queries also include statistical outlier detection, showcasing my ability to handle complex data manipulations and derive meaningful business insights that can drive strategic decisions in e-commerce.
