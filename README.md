# Yunjeong Chang - Data Analysis portfolio

# **About**
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Yunjeong Chang, a passionate data analyst with a strong background in statistics, research, and data-driven decision-making. I am currently pursuing a Data Analyst diploma at Hyper Island in Stockholm, Sweden, where I am further learning my analytical and technical skills.

I hold a Master’s Degree in Child Development and Family Studies from KyungHee University and a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from SungShin Women’s University. My academic background, coupled with hands-on project experience, has equipped me with a deep understanding of data analysis, which I’ve further developed through various professional roles.

During my time as a Lead Researcher at KyungHee University’s Preventative Medicine Lab, I successfully led a team of 32 field researchers for the National Health Survey. I managed the entire research process—from recruitment to data analysis—utilizing tools like SAS and Excel to ensure accuracy. This role sharpened my ability to interpret complex datasets and present insights through clear and impactful data visualizations.

Additionally, my work with CrowdWorks and ActiveFence allowed me to collaborate with major companies like Naver Zepeto. I managed teams of freelancers, optimized workflows, and significantly improved project outcomes. These experiences helped me master the nuances of remote work and adapt quickly to diverse datasets.

In this portfolio, you’ll find examples of my work, including data visualizations, project reports, and detailed analysis that demonstrate my proficiency in SQL, Python, SAS, R, and Tableau. Each project reflects my ability to apply statistical methods to real-world problems.

I’m passionate about using data to drive meaningful, informed decisions and am always eager to contribute to innovative, data-driven initiatives. Thank you for visiting my portfolio — I look forward to exploring new opportunities and collaborating on impactful projects.

   It's my final project for Hyper Island.

   I'm tried to apply my new knowledge in Machine learning & Deep learning with my current knowledge on data analysis.

   Since some images and charts are broken in the file, I attached the link of Jupyter Notebook.

   It has three parts.

   This is part of a poster paper submitted to an academic conference, summarizing the keywords related to male parenting in articles reported by the Korean media each year.

   "Men's parenting activities" was the main focus of my research during my master's studies, and I observed changing trends over time with this project.

   We collected all relevant articles from major media outlets by searching for "male parenting," then cleaned the data to remove unnecessary words like prepositions.

   I then standardized terms with similar meanings for consistency and created word clouds for each year based on this normalized data.


   
5. SAS_Community Health Survey Report of Korea (2021)
   
   Link: https://chs.kdca.go.kr/chs/recsRoom/healthStatsMain.do

   This data is hosted on a Korean government website and is only available in Korean.

   Our lab is responsible for the northern part of Seoul, and we collaborate with two other universities to compile comprehensive statistics for the entire city.

   I standardize terms with similar meanings to ensure consistency and create yearly word clouds based on this normalized data.


# **Company Analysis**
1. GA4_Kitchen Appliance company analysis

   **Presentation**: [slides.pdf](https://github.com/zlal12/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/Company%20Analysis/GA4_Kitchen%20appliance%20company%20analysis.pdf)

   This work is part of a student project we are conducting with a real-world client company.

   Our client recently expanded its market outside of Sweden and is looking to gain more insights into these new regions.

   They provided us with access to their company's Google Analytics 4 data, which we analyzed to uncover valuable insights.

   My focus was on the Nordic market, which is currently the largest. I compared two countries within this region that have similar user sizes but a sixfold difference in revenue.

   We discovered distinct traffic acquisition patterns between these two countries. Notably, we identified a specific channel that drives a significant amount of traffic to the site, which the company was previously unaware of.

   These findings can provide the client with valuable insights into where to focus their marketing efforts in these countries and test whether this channel could be effective in other markets as well.
