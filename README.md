# Yunjeong Chang - Data Analysis portfolio

# **About**
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Yunjeong Chang, and I am a dedicated data analyst with a strong background in statistics, research, and data-driven decision-making. Currently, I am advancing my skills through a Data Analyst diploma program at Hyper Island in Stockholm, Sweden.

I hold a Master’s Degree in Child Development and Family Studies from KyungHee University and a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from SungShin Women’s University. My academic journey has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of data analysis, which I have further honed through various professional experiences and projects.

In my role as a Lead Researcher at KyungHee University’s Preventative Medicine Lab, I led a team of 32 field researchers for the National Health Survey. I managed the entire research process, from recruiting field researchers to analyzing data with SAS and presenting findings through data visualizations. This experience refined my analytical skills and my ability to communicate complex data insights effectively.

My work experience with CrowdWorks and Activefence allowed me to collaborate with major game company and contribute to building a comprehensive database. These roles required meticulous attention to detail and the ability to adapt to diverse datasets and remote work environments.

In this portfolio, you will find examples of my work, including detailed analysis, data visualizations, and project reports. Each piece showcases my proficiency in SQL, Python, SAS, R, and Tableau, as well as my ability to apply statistical methods to real-world problems.

I am passionate about using data to drive informed decisions and am eager to apply my skills to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and contribute to exciting data-driven initiatives.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

   This is part of a poster paper submitted to an academic conference, summarizing the keywords related to male parenting in articles reported by the Korean media each year.

   "Men's parenting activities" was the main focus of my research during my master's studies, and I observed changing trends over time with this project.

   We collected all relevant articles from major media outlets by searching for "male parenting," then cleaned the data to remove unnecessary words like prepositions.

   I then standardized terms with similar meanings for consistency and created word clouds for each year based on this normalized data.


   
5. SAS_Community Health Survey Report of Korea (2021)
   
   Link: https://chs.kdca.go.kr/chs/recsRoom/healthStatsMain.do

   This data is hosted on a Korean government website and is only available in Korean.

   Our lab is responsible for the northern part of Seoul, and we collaborate with two other universities to compile comprehensive statistics for the entire city.

   I standardize terms with similar meanings to ensure consistency and create yearly word clouds based on this normalized data.


# **Company Analysis**
1. GA4_Kitchen Appliance company analysis

   **Presentation**: [slides.pdf](https://github.com/zlal12/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/Company%20Analysis/GA4_Kitchen%20appliance%20company%20analysis.pdf)

   This work is part of a student project we are conducting with a real-world client company.

   Our client recently expanded its market outside of Sweden and is looking to gain more insights into these new regions.

   They provided us with access to their company's Google Analytics 4 data, which we analyzed to uncover valuable insights.

   My focus was on the Nordic market, which is currently the largest. I compared two countries within this region that have similar user sizes but a sixfold difference in revenue.

   We discovered distinct traffic acquisition patterns between these two countries. Notably, we identified a specific channel that drives a significant amount of traffic to the site, which the company was previously unaware of.

   These findings can provide the client with valuable insights into where to focus their marketing efforts in these countries and test whether this channel could be effective in other markets as well.
