   This work is part of a student project we are conducting with a real-world client company.

   Our client recently expanded its market outside of Sweden and is looking to gain more insights into these new regions.

   They provided us with access to their company's Google Analytics 4 data, which we analyzed to uncover valuable insights.

   My focus was on the Nordic market, which is currently the largest. I compared two countries within this region that have similar user sizes but a sixfold difference in revenue.

   We discovered distinct traffic acquisition patterns between these two countries. Notably, we identified a specific channel that drives a significant amount of traffic to the site, which the company was previously unaware of.

   These findings can provide the client with valuable insights into where to focus their marketing efforts in these countries and test whether this channel could be effective in other markets as well.
