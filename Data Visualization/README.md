   This is part of a poster paper submitted to an academic conference, summarizing the keywords related to male parenting in articles reported by the Korean media each year.

   "Men's parenting activities" was the main focus of my research during my master's studies, and I observed changing trends over time with this project.

   We collected all relevant articles from major media outlets by searching for "male parenting," then cleaned the data to remove unnecessary words like prepositions.

   I then standardized terms with similar meanings for consistency and created word clouds for each year based on this normalized data.

   This data is hosted on a Korean government website and is only available in Korean.

   Our lab is responsible for the northern part of Seoul, and we collaborate with two other universities to compile comprehensive statistics for the entire city.

   I standardize terms with similar meanings to ensure consistency and create yearly word clouds based on this normalized data.
